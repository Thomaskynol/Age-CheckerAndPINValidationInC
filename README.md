# Age Checker and PIN Validation in C

This is a simple C program designed to practice fundamental programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, and handling user input. The program consists of two parts:

1. **Age Checker**: Asks the user for their age and prints whether they are an adult or a minor based on their input.
2. **PIN Validation**: Asks the user to input a PIN code and repeatedly requests a correct PIN until the user enters the correct one (2010 in this case).

## Features:
- **Age Checker**: Determines if the user is an adult or minor based on their age.
- **PIN Validation**: Implements a basic PIN code validation system that keeps asking until the correct PIN is entered.

## How to Use:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Compile the C program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
3. Run the program.
4. Follow the prompts to input your age and PIN.
